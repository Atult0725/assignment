    "Ans- Method overriding is a feature of object-oriented programming languages where a subclass can provide a new implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. The new implementation in the subclass will override the behaviour of the method in the parent class. This allows a subclass to inherits the attributes and methods of its parent class. This aalows a subclass to inherits the zttributes and methods of its parent class and then customize their behaviour as needed.\n",
